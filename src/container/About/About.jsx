          <h2>Who I Am</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Aman. I am a Front-End Developer with experience
            specializing in web development, user interface design, cross
            browser development, app maintenance and data migration. Adept at
            identifying opportunities to enhance front-end design and improve
            the user experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            I specialize in building mobile responsive front-end UI applications
            that connect with API’s and other backend technologies. I’m
            passionate about learning new technologies and understand there is
            more than one way to accomplish a task. Though I am most proficient
            in building front-end applications using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and
            React, I am a quick learner and can pick up new tech stacks as
            needed. I believe that being a great developer is not using one
            specific language, but choosing the best tool for the job.
